# Consul::Bucket::List

A presentational component for rendering a list of Consul 'buckets'
(a single partition and/or a single namepace).

Please note this is not your usual "scrollable list component" more a list of
'buckets' that make up a partition / namespace combination.

If only a the namespace is different to the currently selected namespace, then
the namespace will be displayed, whereas if the partition is different it will
show both the partition and namespace (as a namespace called 'team-1' in
`partition-1` is different to a namespace called 'team-1' in `partition-2`)

If you don't need the nspace only support for the view you are building then
omit the `@nspace` argument.

At the time of writing, this is not currently used across the entire UI
(specifically in intentions and maybe other areas) but eventually should be.


```hbs preview-template
<DataSource
  @src={{uri "/partition/default/dc-1/gateways/for-service/service-name"}} as |source|>
    <Consul::Bucket::List
      @item={{object-at 0 source.data}}
      @nspace={{'nspace'}}
      @partition={{'partition'}}
    />
</DataSource>
```
