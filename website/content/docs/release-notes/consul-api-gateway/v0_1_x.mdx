# Consul API Gateway 0.1.0

## OVerview

This is the first General Availability (GA) release of Consul API Gateway. It
provides controlled access for network traffic, from outside a Consul service
mesh, to Services on the mesh

In Kubernetes deployments, it can be used as an alternative to Consul's Ingress
Gateway and provides capabilities Ingress Gateway does not. These include:

1. It allows you to configure and deploy new gateways at any time, without
   rerunning the Consul Helm chart. The configuration of a running gateway can
   be changed dynamically at anytime, usually without disrupting any the the
   traffic flowing through it.
1. Listeners on a gateway can use TLS server certificates signed by any
   Certificate Authority (CA). This allows you to use certificates from public
   CA's, like Verisign and Let's Encrypt, and private CA's, such as a company's
   internal CA.

## Release Highlights

1. **Supported Runtimes:** Kubernetes - self managed, AWS EKS, Google GKE and Azure AKS.
1. Install via the  HashiCorp Consul Helm chart.
1. Works with self-managed Consul servers and HCP Consul servers
1. Configure via Kubernetes Gateway API - v1alpha2
1. Deploy 1 or more logical API Gateways per Kubernetes cluster
1. Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TCP+TLS
1. Supported HTTP versions: 1.1 & 2
1. Load balance across a serviceâ€™s instances
1. Listeners load TLS certificates, signed by any CA, from Kubernetes Secret Storage
1. Route HTTP/S traffic to Services based on matching:
   - Hostname
   - URI Path
   - HTTP Header
   - HTTP Method
   - HTTP Query parameters
1  HTTP Header manipulation:
   - Set header value
   - Add header and/or value
   - Remove header and/or value
1. TLS settings configurable per Listener:
   - Set minimum allowed TLS version
   - Enabled cipher-suites (a.k.a. Cipher string)
1. Route to services in different Name Spaces
1. Split traffic across multiple services, based on weight
1. Support multi-runtime service mesh deployments
   - The Consul API Gateway must be running on Kubernetes but it can route
     traffic to services running outside of K8s as long the service is connected
     to the Consul service mesh.
