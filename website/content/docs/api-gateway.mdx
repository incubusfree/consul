# Consul API Gateway

The Consul API Gateway add-on module helps users control access to services running within a Consul service mesh. Using the API Gateway, applications and services running in a Consul datacenter can be accessed by network clients residing outside of the datacenter. This type of network traffic is commonly referred to as "north-south" network traffic as it refers to the flow of data into and out of a specific environment. Requests from clients can also be forwarded based on path or request protocol. 

## Introduction

Consul API Gateway is an implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway [API Specification](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). This specification defines a set of custom resource definitions (CRD) that can create logical gateways and routes based on the path or protocol of a client request. The Consul API gateway solves for two primary use cases:

* **Controlling access at the point entry** - The Consul API Gateway allows users to set the protocols of external connection requests and provide clients with TLS certificates from trusted providers (e.g. VeriSign, Letâ€™sEncrypt). 
* **Simplifying traffic management** - The Consul API Gateway can be used to load balance requests across services and route traffic to the appropriate service based on matching one or more criteria such as hostname, path, header presence or value, and HTTP Method type (e.g. Get, Post, Patch).

## Requirements

Your datacenter must meet the following requirements prior to configuring the Consul API Gateway:

- A Kubernetes cluster must be running
- Consul 1.11.2+

## Installation

1. Create a values file for your Consul server agents that contains the following parameters:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard filename="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  name: consul
  image: 'hashicorp/consul:1.11.2'
  tls:
    enabled: true
connectInject:
  enabled: true
controller:
  enabled: true
```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Install Consul API Gateway using the standard Consul Helm chart and specify the custom values file.

```shell-session
$ helm install consul hashicorp/consul --version 0.39.0 --values values.yaml
```

The following components will be installed: - Gateway controller - CRDs required by the Kubernetes Gateway API specification - `kustomize` manifests for completing the installation

1. After `helm` installs Consul API Gateway packages, issue the following commands to apply the API gateway to your Kubernetes cluster.

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --kustomize="github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/config/crd?ref=v0.1.0-beta"
$ kubectl apply --kustomize="github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/config?ref=v0.1.0-beta"
```

## Usage

1. Verify that the [requirements](#requirements) have been met.
1. Verify that the Consul API Gateway software has been installed and applied (see [Installation](#installation)).
1. Configure the gateway, listener(s), and route(s) as described in [Configuration](#configuration)
1. Issue the `kubectl apply` command to implement the configurations, e.g.:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --values gateway-configuration.yaml
```

### Using the Consul API Gateway Binary

You can download the Consul API Gateway binary and use it to manually start the control plane server.

1. Download the binary from the [Consul API Gateway repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway).
1. Navigate to the `consul-api-gateway-main` directory and build the binary:

```shell-session
$ go build
```

1.  (Optional) Copy the binary to the execution path, e.g.:

```shell-session
$ cp consul-api-gateway /usr/bin
```

1.  Use the `server` command to interact with the Consul API Gateway binary:

```shell-session
$ ./consul-api-gateway server <options>
```

The following options are supported:

You can also issue the `version` command to print the Consul API Gateway version to the console:

```shell-session
$ ./consul-api-gateway version
consul-api-gateway 0.1.0
```

## Configuration

Create the following artifacts to configure the API Gateway:

- [Gateway](#gateway): Defines the gateway properties, including listeners.
- [Listeners](#listeners): Defines listener properties, such as protocol, port, and namespace.
- [Routes](#routes): Specifies the path from the client to the listener.

### Gateway

The gateway object contains gateway listeners.
Add the `kind: Gateway` option to the configuration file to declare a gateway.
The following example creates a gateway called `example-gateway` that includes a listener called `https` (see [Listeners](#listeners) for details about the `listener` configuration).

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers highlight="2,4,9,13">

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
  annotations:
    'external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname': DNS_HOSTNAME
spec:
  gatewayClassName: default-consul-gateway-class
  listeners:
    - protocol: HTTPS
      hostname: DNS_HOSTNAME
      port: 443
      name: https
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: Same
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
          - name: gateway-production-certificate
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Refer to the Kubernetes Gateway API documentation for details about configuring gateways:
<https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.Gateway>

### Listeners

Listeners are the logical endpoints bound to the gateway's addresses.
Add the `listener` object to the `gateway` configuration and specify the following properties to define a listener:

- `hostname`: Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types.
- `port`: Specifies the network port.
- `protocol`: Specifies the network protocol expected by the listener.

Refer to the Kubernetes Gateway API documentation for details about configuring listeners:
<https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.Listener>

In the example included the [Gateway](#gateway) description, a listener named `https` that listens over `HTTPS` is configured to listen on port `443`

### Route

Routes are independent configuration objects that are associated with specific listeners.
Use the `kind: HTTPRoute` option to declare a route and use the `spec` option to specify the route details.
The following example creates a route named `example-route` associated with a listener defined in `example-gateway`.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: example-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: example-gateway
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - kind: Service
          name: echo
          port: 8080
```
