# MeshService

This topic provides full details about the MeshService resource.

## Introduction

A `MeshService` is a resource in the Kubernetes cluster that represents a service in the Consul service mesh outside the Kubernetes cluster where Consul API Gateway is deployed. The service must be in the same Consul datacenter. The MeshService exists so that other configuration models in Kubernetes, such as HTTPRoute and TCPRoute, can reference services that only exist in Consul.
