# Configuration

This topic provides an overview of the configuration items that enable Consul API Gateway to manage traffic into your Consul service mesh.

- [Gateway](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway): Defines the main infrastructure resource that links API gateway components. It specifies the name of the `GatewayClass` and one or more listeners (see [Listeners](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway#listeners)), which specify the logical endpoints bound to the gateway's addresses.
- [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig): Describes additional Consul API Gateway-related configuration parameters for the GatewayClass resource.
- [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass): Defines a class of gateway resources that you can use as a template for creating gateways.
- [Routes](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes): Specifies the path from the gateway to the backend service(s)client to the listener.

You can implement the default [`gatewayClassName`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway#gatewayclassname) (`consul-api-gateway`) to create a basic Gateway object. You can also complete the following steps to create custom Gateways suitable for your environment:

1. Define a [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig) that contains your custom configurations.
1. Define a [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass) and configure the [`parametersRef.name`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass#parametersref-name) to reference the name of your [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig).
1. Define a [Gateway](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway) and configure the [`gatewayClassName`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway#gatewayclassname) to reference the name of your [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass).
