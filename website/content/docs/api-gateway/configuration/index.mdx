# Configuration

This topic provides an overview of the configuration items that enable Consul API Gateway to facilitate ingress into your Consul service mesh.

- [Gateway](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway): Defines the main infrastructure resource that links API gateway components. It specifies the name of the `GatewayClass` and one or more listeners (see [Listeners](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway#listeners)), which specify the logical endpoints bound to the gateway's addresses. Refer to Configuration > Gateway for details on configuration.
- [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig): Describes additional Consul API Gateway-related configuration parameters for the GatewayClass resource.
- [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass): Defines a class of gateway resources that you can use as a template for creating gateways.
- [Routes](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes): Specifies the path from the gateway to the backend service(s)client to the listener.

A basic Gateway object can simply use the default [`gatewayClassName`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway###gatewayClassName) `consul-api-gateway`. For additional configruation options follow the following steps.

1. Define a [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig) containing your desired configurations.
1. Define a [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass) with [`parametersRef.name`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass###parametersRef.name) set to the name of the newly defined [GatewayClassConfig](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig)
1. Define a [Gateway](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway) with [`gatewayClassName`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway###gatewayClassName) set to the name of the newly defined [GatewayClass](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass)
