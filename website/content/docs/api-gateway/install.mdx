# Installing Consul API Gateway

This topic describes how to use the Consul API Gateway add-on module. It includes instructions for installation and configuration.

## Requirements

Ensure that the environment you are deploying Consul API Gateway in meets the requirements listed in the [Technical Specifications][tech-specs]. This includes validating that the requirements for minimum versions of software are met. See the [Release Notes][rel-notes] for the version of API Gateway you are deploying.

## Installation

-> **Version reference convention:** Replace `VERSION` in command and configuration examples with the Consul API Gateway version you are installing, such as `0.3.0`. In some instances, `VERSION` is prepended with a lowercase _v_. This indicates that you must include the `v` as is part of the version, for example `v0.3.0`.

1. Issue the following command to install the CRDs:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl apply --kustomize="github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/config/crd?ref=vVERSION"
   ```

1. Create a `values.yaml` file for your Consul API Gateway deployment. 
1. Copy the following example configuration into the `values.yaml` file. The Consul Helm chart uses the `values.yaml` file to install Consul.

   <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard filename="values.yaml">

   ```yaml
   global:
     name: consul
   connectInject:
     enabled: true
   controller:
     enabled: true
   apiGateway:
     enabled: true
     image: hashicorp/consul-api-gateway:VERSION
    ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>
     
    Refer to the [Consul](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul/tags) and [Consul API Gateway] (https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/tags) DockerHub pages for information about all available versions, as well as additional context about version compatibility published in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/releases). See [Helm Chart Configuration - apiGateway](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/helm#apigateway) for more available options on how to configure your Consul API Gateway deployment via the Helm chart.
1. Install Consul API Gateway using the standard Consul Helm chart and specify the custom values file. Available versions of the [Consul Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/releases) can be found in GitHub releases.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm install consul hashicorp/consul --version 0.45.0 --values values.yaml --create-namespace --namespace consul
   ```
