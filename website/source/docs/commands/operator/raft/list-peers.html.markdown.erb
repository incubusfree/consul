# Operator Raft List-Peers

Command: `consul operator raft list-peers`

This action displays the current Raft peer configuration.

Usage: `consul operator raft list-peers -stale=[true|false]`

* `-stale` - Optional and defaults to "false" which means the leader provides
the result. If the cluster is in an outage state without a leader, you may need
to set this to "true" to get the configuration from a non-leader server.

The output looks like this:

```
Node     ID              Address         State     Voter
alice    127.0.0.1:8300  127.0.0.1:8300  follower  true
bob      127.0.0.2:8300  127.0.0.2:8300  leader    true
carol    127.0.0.3:8300  127.0.0.3:8300  follower  true
```

`Node` is the node name of the server, as known to Consul, or "(unknown)" if
the node is stale and not known.

`ID` is the ID of the server. This is the same as the `Address` in Consul 0.7
but may  be upgraded to a GUID in a future version of Consul.

`Address` is the IP:port for the server.

`State` is either "follower" or "leader" depending on the server's role in the
Raft configuration.

`Voter` is "true" or "false", indicating if the server has a vote in the Raft
configuration. Future versions of Consul may add support for non-voting servers.
