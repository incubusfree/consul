# Operator Raft Remove-Peer

Command: `consul operator raft remove-peer`

This command removes the Consul server with given address from the Raft configuration.

There are rare cases where a peer may be left behind in the Raft configuration
even though the server is no longer present and known to the cluster. This command
can be used to remove the failed server so that it is no longer affects the
Raft quorum. If the server still shows in the output of the
[`consul members`](/docs/commands/members.html) command, it is preferable to
clean up by simply running
[`consul force-leave`](/docs/commands/force-leave.html)
instead of this command.

Usage: `consul operator raft remove-peer -address="IP:port"`

* `-address` - "IP:port" for the server to remove. The port number is usually
8300, unless configured otherwise.

The return code will indicate success or failure.
