# Consul Web UI

Consul comes with support for a beautiful, functional web UI.
The UI can be used for viewing all services and nodes, viewing all
health checks and their current status, and for reading and setting
key/value data. The UI automatically supports multi-datacenter.

There are two options for running a web UI for Consul. The first option is self-hosting and using the [open-source UI](/downloads.html), the second option is using [Atlas by HashiCorp](https://atlas.hashicorp.com) to host the dashboard for you. 

## Atlas-hosted Dashboard
To setup the Atlas UI for Consul, you must add two fields to your configuration â€” the name of your Atlas infrastructure and your Atlas token. Below is an example configuration:

```text
$ consul agent -atlas=ATLAS_USERNAME/demo -atlas-token="ATLAS_TOKEN"
```

To get an Atlas username and token, [create an account here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/account/new?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=getting-started-ui&utm_campaign=consul) and replace the respective values in your Consul configuration with your credentials.

You can view a live demo of the Atlas UI [here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/infrastructures/consul-demo). 

A screenshot of one page of the demo is shown below so you can get an
idea of what the web UI is like.

## Self-hosted Dashboard
To set up the self-hosted UI,
[download the web UI package](/downloads.html)
and unzip it to a directory somewhere on the server where the Consul agent
is also being run. Then append the `-ui-dir` to the `consul agent`
command pointing to the directory where you unzipped the UI (the
directory with the `index.html` file):

```text
$ consul agent -ui-dir /path/to/ui
...
```

The UI is available at the `/ui` path on the same port as the HTTP API.
By default this is `http://localhost:8500/ui`.

You can view a live demo of the Consul Web UI
[here](http://demo.consul.io).

While the live demo is able to access data from all datacenters,
we've also setup demo endpoints in the specific datacenters:
[AMS2](http://ams2.demo.consul.io) (Amsterdam),
[SFO1](http://sfo1.demo.consul.io) (San Francisco),
and [NYC3](http://nyc3.demo.consul.io) (New York).
